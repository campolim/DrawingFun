# Drawing Fun

This app is an Android learning experience primarily for my own personal development. I have followed the tutorial available [here](https://code.tutsplus.com/series/create-a-drawing-app-on-android--cms-704).

Users can draw on a white canvas using 10 different brush colours and 3 different brush sizes. They can also erase using 3 different brush sizes. Users can create a new canvas, and save their creations to their gallery.

As baby steps towards a new app, the paths that users draw slowly fade away.
